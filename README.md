## Overview

AppCleaner for Mac focuses on making every uninstall complete, clean, and predictable. Instead of tossing an app into the Trash and hoping for the best, users can see exactly which files support that application thanks to **[bundle-aware discovery](#)**, **[support file detection](#)**, and **[cache location mapping](#)**. Configuration data, preference lists, and temporary items are displayed together so decisions about removal are informed, not blind.

The utility is intentionally simple on the surface while being careful under the hood. It inspects common macOS folders through **[library folder inspection](#)** and resolves hidden paths using **[hidden path resolution](#)** so that leftover items are less likely to linger out of sight. Before anything is erased, **[deletion review prompts](#)** provide a clear summary of what will be affected, and **[repeatable cleanup routines](#)** help users apply the same standard each time. This approach supports regular testing of new software without letting abandoned components build up silently.

Because AppCleaner is lightweight, it fits comfortably into a regular maintenance routine. Users keep control over storage and system hygiene without complex configuration. Combined with **[resource-conscious scanning](#)** that respects older hardware, it offers a neat way to maintain a responsive, uncluttered macOS installation over the long term.
